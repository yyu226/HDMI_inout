  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

Section 1 - Errors
------------------

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:Place:1109 - A clock IOB / BUFGMUX clock component pair have been found
   that are not placed at an optimal clock IOB / BUFGMUX site pair. The clock
   IOB component <DDC_SCL> is placed at site <C1>. The corresponding BUFG
   component <N36_BUFG> is placed at site <BUFGMUX_X3Y15>. There is only a
   select set of IOBs that can use the fast path to the Clocker buffer, and they
   are not being used. You may want to analyze why this problem exists and
   correct it. This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE
   constraint was applied on COMP.PIN <DDC_SCL.PAD> allowing your design to
   continue. This constraint disables all clock placer rules related to the
   specified COMP.PIN. The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may
   lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition
   be corrected in the design.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   OPTOMA/cSTATE[4]_GND_7_o_Mux_30_o is sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is
   not good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading of data into
   the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   OPTOMA/cSTATE[4]_GND_8_o_Mux_31_o is sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is

   the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net OPTOMA/START is sourced by
   a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to

WARNING:PhysDesignRules:2410 - This design is using one or more 9K Block RAMs
   (RAMB8BWER).  9K Block RAM initialization data, both user defined and
   default, may be incorrect and should not be used.  For more information,
   please reference Xilinx Answer Record 39999.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:1863 - Unexpected differential configuration for comp
   TX0_TMDS<0>. The TMDS0/OBUFDS buffer is programmed as a true differential.
   Adding a pullup, pulldown, or keeper to a differential IO can create signal
   integrity problems and can violate specifications.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:1863 - Unexpected differential configuration for comp
   TX0_TMDS<1>. The TMDS1/OBUFDS buffer is programmed as a true differential.
   Adding a pullup, pulldown, or keeper to a differential IO can create signal
   integrity problems and can violate specifications.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:1863 - Unexpected differential configuration for comp
   TX0_TMDS<2>. The TMDS2/OBUFDS buffer is programmed as a true differential.
   Adding a pullup, pulldown, or keeper to a differential IO can create signal
   integrity problems and can violate specifications.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:1863 - Unexpected differential configuration for comp
   TX0_TMDS<3>. The TMDS3/OBUFDS buffer is programmed as a true differential.
   Adding a pullup, pulldown, or keeper to a differential IO can create signal

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
 122 block(s) removed
  36 block(s) optimized away
 118 signal(s) removed

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic report below shows the logic removed from your design due to
sourceless or loadless signals, and VCC or ground connections.  If the removal
of a signal or symbol results in the subsequent removal of an additional signal
or symbol, the message explaining that second removal will be indented.  This
indentation will be repeated as a chain of related logic is removed.

To quickly locate the original cause for the removal of a chain of logic, look
above the place where that logic is listed in the trimming report, then locate
the lines that are least indented (begin at the leftmost edge).

Section 10 - Timing Report
--------------------------
A logic-level (pre-route) timing report can be generated by using Xilinx static
timing analysis tools, Timing Analyzer (GUI) or TRCE (command line), with the
mapped NCD and PCF files. Please note that this timing report will be generated
using estimated delay information. For accurate numbers, please generate a
timing report with the post Place and Route NCD file.

For more information about the Timing Analyzer, consult the Xilinx Timing
Analyzer Reference Manual; for more information about TRCE, consult the Xilinx
Command Line Tools User Guide "TRACE" chapter.
